  <p>A graduate from AAT Mumbai (formerly SAE) and a freakishly
    ingenious mind, we don’t call Siddharth a perfectionist,
    just for the heck of it. He strives to achieve the impeccable
    and would sit in a chair for 12 hours straight, if he’s not
    satisfied with the output. While some call him dedicated, others
    think he might just be a creative maniac. He excels in drums with
    a Trinity Grade 4 certificate from Delhi School of Music and wouldn’t
    fail to show off his avid multi-instrumental knowledge across the room.
    In his free time, you would definitely find him chasing after some dogs
    and feeding them!</p>
